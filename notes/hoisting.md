   Hoisting
   ---------
  the process where declarations (variables and functions) are moved to the top of their containing scope
  during the compile phase, before the code is executed.

     Not define :- When you try to reference a variable that hasn’t been declared
   anywhere in your code, you get a ReferenceError with the  message "x is not defined".


    Undefine :-  When a variable is declared but hasn't been assigned a value,
   its value is undefined.

  <li> Undefined: The variable has been declared but not assigned a value. It is a valid variable but currently holds the value undefined.</li>

  <li> Not Defined: The variable has not been declared anywhere in the code, and accessing it will result in a ReferenceError.</li>
