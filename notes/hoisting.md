   Hoisting
   ---------
  the process where declarations (variables and functions) are moved to the top of their containing scope
  during the compile phase, before the code is executed.

  # Not define :-
    When you try to reference a variable that hasnâ€™t been declared
    anywhere in your code, you get a ReferenceError with the  message "x is not defined".


   # Undefine :- 
    When a variable is declared but hasn't been assigned a value,
    its value is undefined.
